# CodersClan Frontend Interview Test

### Introduction

If you are here it means you would like to join our Community as a Frontend developer, this is great!
Before you will join our community there is a short test we need you to do, a simple PSD to HTML task. Please read in detail this document.

### What to do next

- Clone this repository to your local pc
- Create a new branch to work on (feel free to name it as you'd like)
- Open the "frontend-test-info.jpg" file to see what is expected from you to deliver, this file includes behavior guidelines that you will need to implement
- The source files are frontend-test.psd and frontend-test-mobile.psd
- Create a new project in the branch which will include sass and javascript compiler, we expect you to develop the page with SCSS and ES6, preferred with Node.JS and Pug (Jade) templating.
- Please include ALL source files including the compile script in the branch, and also the compiled (dist) folder of the delivery and push everything to the remote.
- Once done - please create a merge request from your branch to master, and send an email to your PM (who sent you this repo :) ) so we'll know to check the delivery.

### Transitions

The test doesn't describe the transitions and animations, please do make sure to add animations to make the transitions smoother.

### Expectations

- We are looking for pixel perfect delivery, make sure to match everything exactly as it is in the design, so when using a [pixel-perfect comparison](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en "pixel-perfect comparison"), it will match 100%.
- Keep in mind we develop a dynamic website, make sure to consider the option of repeatable items, different image sizes, and different text, the page should look great regardless of the content in it.
- We expect the code to be minimal, very organized and linted. We won't accept "Spaghetti" code even if the frontend looks perfect. Keep in mind that your code when working with us will be sliced to sections and integrated into WordPress, make the backend developer life easier.
- It goes without saying the delivery should be responsive to support all device resolutions

If you have any questions, feel free to email the PM or Elad at elad@codersclan.com
